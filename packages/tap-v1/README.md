# Timeline Aggregation Protocol Subgraph (TAP Subgraph) 


## Build and deploy

Be sure to check `package.json` where the yarn commands are defined.

```sh
# Install dependencies
yarn
# Build AssemblyScript types using `schema.graphql` and `subgraph.yaml`.
yarn codegen
# Build subgraph
yarn build
# Create a subgraph name locally
yarn create-local
# Deploy subgraph code under name created above
yarn deploy-local
```

At this point, the subgraph will immediately start indexing. You will be able to query
the subgraph immediately on port 8000 (but it will be past data until reaching chain
head, of course).

## Development flow

`yarn create-local` needs to be executed only once. Thereafter, you can replace the
subgraph code under the created name.

```sh
yarn codegen  # Only if subgraph.yaml or schema.graphql changed.
yarn build
yarn deploy-local
```

It will stop indexing the old code, and start the new one in its place.

## Deploying locally

Inside /test are the tools to help you test locally this subgraph
Requirements are:
- jq
- yq
- Node (personally I use 16.14.2)

### Run podman-compose up/ docker-compose up
The file should run as is

### Execute contract_init.sh
This will execute several commands where the contracts attached in the git submodule of timeline-aggregation-protocol-contracts will be executed.
After finishing it will print out the result like this (just in case you want to test something else after):
```
Graph token address: 0xe982E462b094850F12AF94d21D470e21bE9D0E9C
Step 2: Obtain allocation tracker address
Allocation tracker address: 0x25AF99b922857C37282f578F428CB7f34335B379
Step 3: Obtain istaking address
Istaking address: 0xd611F1AF9D056f00F49CB036759De2753EfA82c2
Step 4: Obtain TAPVerifier address
Tap verifier address: 0x995629b19667Ae71483DC812c1B5a35fCaaAF4B8
Step 5: Obtain Escrow address
Escrow address: 0x94dFeceb91678ec912ef8f14c72721c102ed2Df7
```

Afterwards its going to run `contract_calls.py` to handle all different calls to catch later in the subgraph.

Finally it will deploy the subgraph locally to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/subgraphs/name/semiotic/tap/graphql

### If more tests are needed you can run files individually
#### Build and deploy locally

```sh
# Install dependencies
yarn
# Build AssemblyScript types using `schema.graphql` and `subgraph.yaml`.
yarn codegen
# Build subgraph
yarn build
# Create a subgraph name locally
yarn create-local
# Deploy subgraph code under name created above
yarn deploy-local
```

#### Run contract_calls.py
This will execute all the calls towards the escrow contract and the subgraph will index all this new entries.
Authorization for a signer and redeeming will only work the first time, else the data needs to be changed (you can just rerun contract_init.sh and resets all).


## Deploying to a testnet

### Deploy your subgraph into graph studio
Follow the instructions at https://thegraph.com/docs/en/deploying/deploying-a-subgraph-to-studio/
After doing so go into `testnet-calls.py` and add your mnemonic in there so that it can access your wallet.


Afterwards run `python testnet-calls.py` with the arg `eth-goerli` for eth-goerli testnet or `arbitrum-goerli` for arbitrum-goerli testnet. A secondary arg is needed where you will send your wallet mnemonic as a string.
